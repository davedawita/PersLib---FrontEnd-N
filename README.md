We can also say that we use Python-Django stack.  </br>

<h2>MVP Goals</h2>
Full CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) Functionality. </br>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
Please follow route guidelines above to go back to previous page. Refresh the page.   </br>

<h2>Forthcoming Features</h2>
In the future, we need users to be able to give access to family members so that the documents can be viewed by others. In addition, I need to learn Angular (FrontEnd Framework) and do this same app with it. Moreover, I need to create login and logout functionalities with superuser account.
